# Calculator App

A React Native app that performs mathematical calculations

## Some development notes

### Task organization

Because of the simplicity of the project, I decided to organize my (initial) tasks in a [todo list](https://github.com/brunochan2001/Calculator-App/issues/1).

Initial commits have a 'task ID' before a descriptive message to make it easier to understand code changes in the future. The task IDs are from the todo list (for instance, `[i-4]` I add functionality).

### Library decisions

- For the main tech I felt that React Native was a safe bet to quickly set up the repo.
- I used typescript for its flexibility, and it's advantages over just prop-types or flow.
- For tests I just used jest. I only wrote unit tests for the components.

## How to run locally

1. Clone the repo

2. Install

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run a dev environment

```bash
yarn start
```

4. Run tests

```bash
